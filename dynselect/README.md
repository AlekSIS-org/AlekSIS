# DynSelector
The dynamic selector for REBUS is programmed in JavaScript with the great tool React. 
To use it in Django you have to do a build every time you changed something at the JS code.


Before build, check if everything is installed:
```
npm install
```

Then run
```
./build-for-django.sh
```
