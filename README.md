# BiscuIT School Information System (SIS) - Next Generation Platform

## What BiscuIT is

BiscuIT is a web-based school information system (SIS) which can be used to
manage and/or publish organisational subjects of educational institutions.

It was originally developed together with St√§dt. Leibniz-Gymnasium Remscheid
as a proprietary product. Five years after the school stole the original
code base, BiscuIT-ng started as a complete re-implementation as
well-designed, free and open source software.
