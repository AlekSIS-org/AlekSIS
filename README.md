# BiscuIT School Information System (SIS) - Next Generation Platform

## What BiscuIT is

BiscuIT is a web-based school information system (SIS) which can be used to
manage and/or publish organisational subjects of educational institutions.

It was originally developed together with St√§dt. Leibniz-Gymnasium Remscheid
as a proprietary product. Five years after the school stole the original
code base, BiscuIT-ng started as a complete re-implementation as
well-designed, free and open source software.

BiscuIT-ng is a platform based on Django, that provides central funstions
and data structures that can be used by apps that are developed and provided
seperately. The core can interact closely with the Debian Edu / Skolelinux
system.
